# Terraria-Bunny
This program automatically gives you the Bunny in Terraria with no hands on registry editing. It requires at least .NET 4.5

Download the pre-compiled exe to run, or compile it yourself.

If for some reason you do not trust this the MD5, SHA1, and SHA-256 hashes are as follows:

MD5: E77E0082A1132CEDA10A27609DB247AB

SHA1: C762DA739BC0C5C712F6A0F33AE364FF4A9D0373

SHA-256: A9EA313D8DD5DCC2FC89100F1C5BC32495A15A36158D977A2CB9EA549F5C948A

These are the hashes I got, feel free to check your compiled version with mine. If compiled for .NET Framework 4.5 it should be 100% the same.
