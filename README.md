# Terraria-Bunny
This program automatically gives you the Bunny in Terraria with no hands on registry editing. It requires at least .NET 4.

Download the pre-compiled exe to run, or compile it yourself.

If for some reason you do not trust this the MD5, SHA1, and SHA-256 hashes are as follows:

MD5: 0431662230BC89A958ADF882238F24E3
SHA1: 16E7609F7BB90E3CAEE5E418603DED976DB4AD13
SHA-256: 3FC6ED39DCB2D10BEEE50B9E183843441EB1A1F199E9003E2DF7204143544AC4

These are the hashes I got, feel free to check your compiled version with mine. If compiled for .NET Framework 4 it should be 100% the same.
